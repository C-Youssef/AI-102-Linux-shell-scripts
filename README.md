## Bash (Linux) shell scripts for the AI-102 AI ENGINEER labs

This repository contains Bash shell scripts that are needed to complete the [AI-102 AI ENGINEER labs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AI-102-AIEngineer/) using Linux or macOS. The labs are part of the Microsoft course [AI-102 Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/learn/certifications/courses/ai-102t00). 

They should be used conjointly with the [AI-102-AIENGINEER repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AI-102-AIEngineer). The AI-102 labs include Windows command shell (cmd) batch files that can only be used on Windows PCs. 

Each shell script in this repository with the name **xx-fileName.sh** was converted from a cmd batch file **fileName.cmd** that is included in lab number **xx** in the AI-102-AIENGINEER repository.

To run shell script **xx-fileName.sh**, copy it to its corresponding AI-102 lab directory, change to that directory, make the script executable by running ***sudo u+x xx-fileName.sh***, and run the command ***./xx-fileName.sh***.

Note that cmd files in the AI-102 labs with a single curl command were omitted, since they can simply be copied and pasted to a terminal.
